# Intro

I'm a senior at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science and Math. Most recently, I worked as a software engineer intern at the Chicago Blackhawks, a NHL hockey team. Before that, I was a web development intern and a research assistant at the University of Illinois. In my free time, I love listening to classical music (one of my favorite pastimes is to analyze piano competitions), reading, playing a way too unhealthy amount of video games, and watching random youtube videos until 3 AM. I'm eternally curious, and always interested in the world around me. Feel free to contact me!
